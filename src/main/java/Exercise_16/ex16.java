/*
Write a program that asks the user for their age and compare it to the legal driving age of sixteen.
If the user is sixteen or older, then the program should display
"You are old enough to legally drive." If the user is under sixteen,
the program should display "You are not old enough to legally drive."

Example Output
What is your age? 15
You are not old enough to legally drive.
Or
What is your age? 35
You are old enough to legally drive.

Constraints
Use a single output statement.
Use a ternary operator to write this program.
If your language doesnâ€™t support a ternary operator, use a regular if/else statement,
 and still use a single output statement to display the message.
